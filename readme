i made this running into an issue with my Dell Inspiron 19a when trying to delete windows and install linux.
i tried debian, ubuntu and mint before. anyways i tried to install Arch btw, and it didnt work it  booted and needed internet from a Wifi Signal or Ethernet. 
the only opyion i had was USB tethering with a phone that didnt allow it. So i write a script to easily just connect to easytether on Mint (way easier to install offline)

all program commands are below.




running portabily
-------------------


connecting easythere to linux is easy as dowlnoading the script and going to https://www.mobile-stream.com/easytether/linux.html and downloading the pc software.

when both are on your computer run ./easytether/sh with your phone plugged in and easytether app on

$> cd/easteather
$> ./easytether.sh


it might show a not connected error after connecting ignore this if the internet is working by going in a internet cli.
-----------------------------



install the commands and auto tether

-------------------





commands come installed by default with auto tether

$> cd/easyteather
$> ./install.sh

-------------------=======
commands
-------------------
easytether - starts easytether (if off)
killeasytether - kills the easytether connection
